# Life Gallery

## Description
Life Gallery was a lesson in using props. I used a component to pass an individual gallery item through a prop to display an image. When you clicked upon an image, it would conditionally render text about the image.

## Problems
Axios calls that were searching for certain url's with '/:id' was a concept I had not worked with. It was very interesting to try and understand that :id was just a placeholder for it to attach to the certain url you are looking for. This was also early on for learning about State in react. Not being able to see what's going on in our code because it was in "state" was a very large concept to learn early on. 

## Technology
React, Javascript, Axios, Express
